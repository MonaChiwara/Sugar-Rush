# Sugar-Rush

Welcome to Sugar Rush 

Growing up, my family loved playing Candy Crush, so when the time came to choose a game, Candy Crush was a no-brainer. Sugar Rush is my own version of Candy Crush that is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sugar Rush is a two-player game clear the candies by swipping in any direction to create sets of 3 matching candies. Each player has 30 seconds. The player with the highest score (most matches), wins.

Game Goals :

Must be a two-player browser game - is a two player

A winning state - most matches of 3

A lose state - less matches

A way to keep playing if the game is not over - restart

Features I'm most proud of: Drag and Drop

Challenges I faced - trying to come up with a way to get input from the first player and compare it with the second player

Unresolved issues - did not add limits to where the candy can be dragged to.
